### What is this?
A clean and simple swift class to sync UserDefaults to iCloud--based off of the Objective C class by Mugunth Kumar.

### How to use?
1. Make sure your project has an iCloud Key-Value Store defined
2. Include this file in your project
3. Instantiate an instance (either in AppDelegate or SceneDelegate or whereever)
4. Call 'start' -- either with a single key or an array of keys.
